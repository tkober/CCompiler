**Selfmade Compiler Frontend for C**

Final project of a university course on Compiler Design

http://moduldb.htwsaar.de/cgi-bin/moduldb-c?bkeys=pi&ckeys=cbau&lang=en

* Built using Flex and Bison. 
* Creates an AST and a symbol table for a given **standalone** C file (does not include a preprocessor)
* If wanted the resulting AST can be simplified and visualized (simplification is pretty slow due to naive implementation)
